I'm Rob! You'll know because I'll always be the one with a "stupid question" that may be solved by more than three minutes worth of googling. I also enjoy tacos though I'm mostly vegetarian these day. That's enough about me. I'm here to learn your Github lingo & make use of your wonderful software.
